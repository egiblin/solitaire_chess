# Solitaire Chess

Here's my work for the coding challenge of creating a game of Solitaire Chess. The main file for the program is chess.rb.

## Current Issues/Plans For Down The Road

Currently, the biggest issue is seeing as movement is done from square to square, the app doesn't account for pieces in between the two squares that would impede the movement between the two squares. To adjust for that, I would just test the movement of the piece one square at a time and see if the square is occupied.

Also, there's no visualization yet. I was working on finishing the logic fully before I added that.
